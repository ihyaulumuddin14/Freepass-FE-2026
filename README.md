* **Local Persistence**: Integrate **Local Storage** (e.g., Hive, SQLite, or SharedPreferences) to ensure data remains available offline.

### 2. Networking & Data
* **API Integration**: Perform RESTful API calls using methods such as `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, and `DELETE`.
* **Error Handling**: Implement comprehensive logic to manage exceptions, such as network timeouts, API errors, and empty states.
* **Data Source**: You are free to use any [Public API](https://github.com/public-apis/public-apis) or your own custom backend. 
    > **Note:** Evaluation focuses on your data handling logic and architecture rather than the API source itself.

### 3. User Interface (UI/UX)

* [Dribbble](https://dribbble.com/)
* [Behance](https://www.behance.net/)
